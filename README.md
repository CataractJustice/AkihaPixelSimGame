# Game engine
Game is being made inside Entity-Component based game engine written by me https://github.com/CataractJustice/TealEngine

# Progress so far
- Infinite async world generation
- Fluid and Sand-like pixel physics
- Diffusion and solids passing though liquids
- Simple player controller and box-to-pixels collisions

# Work in progress
- GPU accelerated thermal conductivity

# Planned
- GPU accelerated gas fluid simulation
